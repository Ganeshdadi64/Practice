//Why Use the Factory Pattern?
//Encapsulation: The creation logic is hidden inside VehicleFactory.
//Loose Coupling: The client code (main) only interacts with Vehicle and doesnâ€™t worry about instantiation.
//Scalability: If new vehicle types (e.g., Truck, Bus) are added, we can extend Vehicle and update VehicleFactory
//without changing existing code.


//Real-World Analogy
//Think of a vehicle manufacturing plant:
//
//A customer orders a car or bike.
//Instead of them building it, they just request the factory.
//The factory decides and creates the right type based on input.
