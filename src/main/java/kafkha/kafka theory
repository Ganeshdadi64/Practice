Use cases of apachi kafha
========================

1)Messaging

4)streaming process

in application properties lo we are setting consumers and producer properties and
producer: just like a one service which is send some message
consumer: just like a one service which is received a message from producer

here consumers are assigned group ids as well
@kafkaListner(topic name="message1"  groupid="ganesh")
ekkada topic name este aa topic ki ee consumer class subscribe inattu and groupid as well

for example in application properties lo consumer group lo gopi ani undhi like consumer2 class, ee class
message1 nee read cheyya ledu because group different

@kafkaListner(topic name="message2"  groupid="gopi") for consumer1 class
ee message nee consumer class read cheyyaledu because that is another group only consumer1 can read
