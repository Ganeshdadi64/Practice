Use cases of apachi kafha
========================

1)Messaging
2)website activity tracking
3) metrics
4)streaming process

in application properties lo we are setting consumers and producer properties and
producer: just like a one service which is send some message
consumer: just like a one service which is received a message from producer

here consumers are assigned group ids as well
@kafkaListner(topic name="message1"  groupid="ganesh")
ekkada topic name este aa topic ki ee consumer class subscribe inattu and groupid as well

for example in application properties lo consumer group lo gopi ani undhi like consumer2 class, ee class
message1 nee read cheyya ledu because group different

@kafkaListner(topic name="message2"  groupid="gopi") for consumer1 class
ee message nee consumer class read cheyyaledu because that is another group only consumer1 can read



Note:
a

up now we are dealing with only normal string if suppose producer sends a serilizable Json data, we need to deserilize that data and consume
for that we will use JsonDeserilizer inbuild class

Producer Java object nee serilize chesi json ga convert chesi topic ki send chestundhi then consumer aa json datane jsondeserilize chesi java object ga convert chesi use chesukuntundi
producer cannot send java object directly because that consumer may uses python language
