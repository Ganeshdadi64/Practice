1. Checked Exceptions (Compile-Time Exceptions)
These are exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle (either by try-catch or throws).
They are checked at compile time.
If not handled, the code will not compile.
Examples:
IOException
SQLException
FileNotFoundException
ClassNotFoundException
InterruptedException

2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
These occur at runtime and are not checked at compile time.
Java does not force you to handle them.
Typically caused by programming logic errors.
Examples:
NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ArithmeticException
NumberFormatException
IllegalArgumentException

Q) if any exception happened in finally block what happened

the exception happened in finally block it overriden and suppersion remaining exceptions
Key Idea:
If an exception occurs in the finally block, it will override any exception that was thrown in the try or catch block.
The original exception is suppressed and not propagated unless explicitly handled.

The original exception is not lost; it's stored as a suppressed exception in the newer one (from finally)


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new RuntimeException("Exception from try");
        } finally {
            throw new RuntimeException("Exception from finally");
        }
    }
}
output:Exception from finally"


Q) Difference b/t throws and thros keyword

ðŸ”¹ 1. throw Keyword
Feature	    Description
Purpose   	Used to actually throw an exception (either checked or unchecked).
Usage       Location	Used inside a method or block.
Syntax   	throw new ExceptionType("Message");
Limit   	Can throw only one exception at a time.
Example 	throw new ArithmeticException("Divide by zero!");

ðŸ”¹ 2. throws Keyword
Feature	       Description
Purpose     	Used to declare exceptions that a method might throw.
Usage           Location	Used in method signature.
Syntax      	returnType methodName() throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2 {}
Limit	       Can declare multiple exceptions.
Example	       public void readFile() throws IOException, SQLException
