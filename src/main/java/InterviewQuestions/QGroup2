1)what are the new feature of java17?

i)sealed classes
   Sealed classes restrict which other classes can extend them.
   Useful for defining controlled hierarchies.

 use cases:This is useful for ensuring better encapsulation, maintainability, and security.
 // Only Car and Truck can extend Vehicle
 public sealed class Vehicle permits Car, Truck {}

 final class Car extends Vehicle {}   // Allowed
 final class Truck extends Vehicle {} // Allowed
 // class Bus extends Vehicle {}   // ❌ Compilation Error


ii)✅ Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview) – JEP 406
   Enables more concise switch expressions with pattern matching.


   static void printValue(Object obj) {
       switch (obj) {
           case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
           case String s -> System.out.println("String: " + s);
           default -> System.out.println("Unknown");
       }
   }


actuall ga switch syntax nee modify chesaru



1. Oops
2. Why multiple inheritance not possible
3. Wap to find larger num
4. Wap to find  2nd largest num
5. Java 8 features
6. Lambda expression   skip
7. Do 3,4 using lambda
===================================================
import java.util.function.BiFunction;

public class LambdaLargerNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Lambda to find the larger number
        BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> findLarger = (a, b) -> (a > b) ? a : b;

        int num1 = 3;
        int num2 = 4;

        int result = findLarger.apply(num1, num2);

        System.out.println("The larger number is: " + result);
    }
}

8. Even num program  skip
===================================
9. Design patterns   skip
10. Singleton pattern and it's implementation  skip
11. Springboot annotations   skip
12. @qualifier annotations skip

13. Actuators
======================================
Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in endpoints that give insight into your app’s health, metrics,
logs, environment, and more — without writing extra code.

14. Different methods in rest get put post ...  skp
=================================================
15. What is rest api   skip
16. Jpa entity     skip
17. Sql query to find 2nd highest salary
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

18. Types of join   skip
=======================
19. Javascript == and === difference  skip

20. Js how do you call apis

21. Why css is used
22. Java streams ?
23. Difference between areaylist and linkedlist    skip
24. Difference between hashmap and hashtable
🧱 3. Null Keys & Values
Feature	             HashMap	   Hashtable
Allows null key?	✅ Yes (only one)	❌ No
Allows null values?	✅ Yes	            ❌ No
25. What are collecections


1. Whay only writing main in public static void main (STRING ...ARGS)
✅ So, main is not just any method — it’s the standard method name that JVM is hardcoded to call when a program starts.

Keyword	Meaning
public	JVM needs to access it from outside the class, so it must be public.
static	No object needed to call it. JVM can directly invoke it without creating an object.
void	It doesn't return anything.
main	The method name that JVM looks for. Must be exactly main.
String[] args	This is how command-line arguments are passed to your program.


2. Why string args and not obj3ct args   skip

3. What is reflection

🪞 What is Reflection in Java?
Reflection is a feature in Java that allows you to:

Inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and constructors at runtime — even if you don’t know them at compile time.

.

🔍 What Can You Do with Reflection?
✅ Inspect class name, methods, fields, annotations
✅ Access private fields and methods
✅ Create objects at runtime
✅ Call methods dynamically
✅ Change values of fields even if they’re private



4. What is dependency injection how it's working internally
===========================================================
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where objects are given their dependencies from the outside,
rather than creating them inside the class.



🧠 Internally:
Spring scans all classes with @Component, @Service, etc.

It builds a map of beans (beanName -> instance)

When it sees @Autowired, it:

Uses reflection to find the field/constructor

Fetches the correct bean from the map

Uses Field.set() or constructor injection to inject it

5.How does arraylist increases its size?

  How do you perform search in linkedlist

  In what scenario arraylist is better and when linkedlist

  How all annotations are working?

  What is bean and dependent injection
